## What we need ?

### Plyer

*Plyer is an open source library to access features commonly found in various platforms via python.*

## Installing required python packages

*we need to download two important packages for this application.*

*Open your terminal and run the following command.*

- **1.requests** :

in case you want to fetch data from the web

```terminal
 pip install requests
```

- **2. plyer** :

For creating notifications on your PC

```terminal
pip install plyer
```

*Now that we have the packages, we are ready to import it in our python script.*

```py
from plyer import notification
```

## Coding Timuu

- Now let's specify the parameters.

```py
from plyer import notification

title = 'Hi, Hello and Hi !'

message= 'If u reading this ~I LOVE U TO THE MOON AND BACK !!'

notification.notify(title= title,
                    message= message,
                    app_icon = "heart.ico",
                    timeout= 15,
                    toast= False)

time.sleep(60*60)
```

- Let's look at what the parameters mean:

```markdown
Syntax: notify(title=”, message=”, app_name=”, app_icon=”, timeout=10, ticker=”, toast=False)
```

Parameters:

- `title (str`) : Title of the notification

- `app_icon (str)` : Icon to be displayed along with the message
- `timeout (int)` : time to display the message for, defaults to 10
- `time.sleep` : After displaying a notification, we will make it sleep for 1 hour or 60 minutes. You can choose a different interval.
